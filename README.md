## Get Started
### Prerequisites
- Linux (MacOS and Windows are not currently officially supported)
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- CUDA 10.2+
- IDA pro 7.5+ (only used for dataset processing)

### Quick Start

**a. Create a conda virtual environment and activate it.**
```
conda create -n jtrans python=3.8 pandas tqdm -y
conda activate jtrans
```

**b. Install PyTorch and other packages.**
```
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=11.0 -c pytorch
python -m pip install simpletransformers networkx pyelftools
```

**c. Get code and models of jTrans.**
```
git clone https://github.com/vul337/jTrans.git && cd jTrans
```
Download [experiments.tar.gz](https://cloud.vul337.team:8443/s/wmqzYFyJnSEfEgm) and [models.tar.gz](https://cloud.vul337.team:8443/s/tM5qGQPJa6iynCf) and extract them.
```
tar -xzvf experiments.tar.gz && tar -xzvf models.tar.gz
```

**d. Get the BinaryCorp dataset
Download the processed dataset from this [link](https://cloud.vul337.team:8443/s/cxnH8DfZTADLKCs)**

**e. Finetune new models on the BinaryCorp**
```
python finetune.py -h
```

**d. Evaluation**
```
python eval_save.py -h
python fasteval.py -h
```
try to evaluate jTrans on BinaryCorp-3M after extracting experiments.tar.gz
```
python fasteval.py
```

**f. Try jTrans on your own binaries**

Make sure you have IDA pro 7.5+ and following the instructions at [datautils](datautils/README.md). After extracting features of your binaries, you can try jTrans on them such as the usage at [eval_save.py](./eval_save.py).

## Dataset
- We present a new large-scale and diversified dataset, [BinaryCorp](https://cloud.vul337.team:8443/s/cxnH8DfZTADLKCs), for the task of binary code similarity detection. 
- The description of the dataset can be found at [here](datautils/README.md) and we give an [example](datautils/playdata.py) for using BinaryCorp.
- If you need to use features that we do not provide in advance, such as call graphs, you can download the raw binaries from [here](https://cloud.vul337.team:8443/s/W57ZWXxn7zSKG4q).

abstract = {Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) has important applications in various fields such as vulnerabilities detection, software component analysis, and reverse engineering. Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) can comprehend instructions or control-flow graphs (CFG) of binary code and support BCSD. In this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based approach, namely jTrans, to learn representations of binary code. It is the first solution that embeds control flow information of binary code into Transformer-based language models, by using a novel jump-aware representation of the analyzed binaries and a newly-designed pre-training task. Additionally, we release to the community a newly-created large dataset of binaries, BinaryCorp, which is the most diverse to date. Evaluation results show that jTrans outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on this more challenging dataset by 30.5% (i.e., from 32.0% to 62.5%). In a real-world task of known vulnerability searching, jTrans achieves a recall that is 2X higher than existing SOTA baselines.},
